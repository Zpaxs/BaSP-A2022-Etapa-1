# Trackgenix

## _A tool designed to improve work productivity_

### **What is Trackgenix?**

With Trakgenix you can create and organize work projects keeping track of tasks done and hours worked to accomplish your team goals in the easiest and fastest way.

It has different profile settings such as Employees, PM Eployees, Admins and SuperAdmins to provide more or less responsability depending on the user.

### This project is still under development.

### Week-01:

I created a screenflow for the app using Figma, where all the screens for the app were created.

### Week-02:

I made an HTML document that had the content of the landing page for the Trackgenix app using the desktop version.

### Week-03:

I added the corresponding styles to the HTML structure with css.

### Week-04:

I worked on making the [landing](https://zpaxs.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-04/) page responsive using flexbox and media queries.

### Week-05:

I practiced with javascript [exercises](https://zpaxs.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-05/) to try what i've learned.

### Week-06:

Im currently working on form validations in the [login](https://zpaxs.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-06/views/login.html) and [sing-up](https://zpaxs.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-06/views/sign-up.html) with javascript.
